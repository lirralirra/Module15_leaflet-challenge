# Module15_leaflet-challenge

Only part 1 in this repo

In the **static/js/logic.js**

1. creating Earthquake Visualisation by taking data from  USGS GeoJSON Feed (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php),

2. choosing the datasets  'All Earthquakes in the Past Week' from the website

3. then using Leaflet to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude, with 

a) **popups** that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked, and 

b) a **legend** that provides context for the map data
